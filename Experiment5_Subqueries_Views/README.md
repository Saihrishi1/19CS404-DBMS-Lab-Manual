# Experiment 5: Subqueries and Views

## AIM
To study and implement subqueries and views.

## THEORY

### Subqueries
A subquery is a query inside another SQL query and is embedded in:
- WHERE clause
- HAVING clause
- FROM clause

**Types:**
- **Single-row subquery**:
  Sub queries can also return more than one value. Such results should be made use along with the operators in and any.
- **Multiple-row subquery**:
  Here more than one subquery is used. These multiple sub queries are combined by means of ‘and’ & ‘or’ keywords.
- **Correlated subquery**:
  A subquery is evaluated once for the entire parent statement whereas a correlated Sub query is evaluated once per row processed by the parent statement.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```
### Views
A view is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL SELECT query.
**Create View:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Drop View:**
```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

**Question 1**

Write a SQL query to Retrieve the medications with dosages equal to the lowest dosage

Table Name: Medications (attributes: medication_id, medication_name, dosage)

```sql

SELECT medication_id as medic,medication_name,dosage
FROM Medications
WHERE dosage = (SELECT MIN(dosage) FROM Medications );

```

**Question 2**

From the following tables, write a SQL query to find all the orders issued by the salesman 'Paul Adam'. Return ord_no, purch_amt, ord_date, customer_id and salesman_id.

FROM orders o
JOIN salesman s
ON o.salesman_id = s.salesman_id
WHERE s.name = 'Paul Adam';
